<h2>Randomizing an Array using the Fischer Yates Algorithm</h2>

We implemented a method for randomizing a deck of cards. However, the algorithm that we provided was rather inefficient. For the first part of this programming assignment, you are to replace the shuffle method with the Fischer Yates algorithm for randomizing an array. For this activity,  your changes should be isolated to the source file, Deck.java.

<h2>ArrayList</h2>

The second part of this assignment is also isolated to the source file, Deck.java. For this part of the assignment, you are to replace the Card array with an ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; in the Deck class.
